# Melting Pot Contest @ Neurips 2023
Official Repository for Melting Pot Contest Experiments

>**NOTE:** This repository provides a basic startup code for training RLLIB agents on Melting Pot.
We plan to add additional support including more examples,
benchmarked configs and GCP compute setup over the next couple of weeks. We will
also make any necessary updates based on feedback from participants. Hence, it is recommended
to sync up your fork every few days for next couple of weeks. We will post in discussion
forums about any updates as they become available.

## Installation Guidelines

### MacOS Ventura 13.2.1 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

The baseline codes and accompanying MeltingPot installation has been tested on MacOS with support for x86_64 platform. If you use newer M1 chips, there may be additional steps required. You are welcome to post in discussion forums if you encounter any issues with installation.

It is recommended to use virtual environments as the setup requires specific versions for some libraries. Below, we provide installation with [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) package manager.

```
git clone <this-repo>
cd <repo-home>
conda create -n mpc_main python=3.10
conda activate mpc_main
SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=0 pip install dmlab2d
pip install -e .
sh run_patches.sh
```

### Google Cloud Platform Setup

Coming Soon!

## How to Guide


### Make Submission
---
The trained models will be available in the results folder configured by you.
Please refer to the guidelines on AICrowd [submision-starter-kit](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/aicrowd/challenges/meltingpot-2023/meltingpot-2023-starter-kit) to make a
submission using the trained checkpoints.

### Visualization
---
#### How to render trained models?

```
python baselines/train/render_models.py [OPTIONS]
```
```
OPTIONS:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config_dir CONFIG_DIR
                        Directory where your experiment config (params.json) is located
  --policies_dir POLICIES_DIR
                        Directory where your trained policies are located
  --horizon HORIZON     No. of environment timesteps to render models
```

#### How to visualize scenario plays?

You can also generate videos of agents behavior in various scenarios during local evaluation.
To do this, set `create_videos=True` and `video_dir='<PATH to video directory>'` while running evaluation.
If `eval_on_scenario=False`, this will create video plays of evaluation on substrate.

```
python baselines/evaluation/evaluate.py --create_videos=True --video_dir='' [OPTIONS]
```

**Note:** The script for generating these videos is located in `VideoSubject` class in `meltingpot/utils/evaluation/evaluation.py`. Modify this class to play with video properties such as codec, fps etc. or use different video writer. If you do not use meltingpot code from this repo, we have found that the generated videos are rendered very tiny. To fix that, add `rgb_frame = rgb_frame.repeat(scale, axis=0).repeat(scale, axis=1)` after `line 88` to extrapolate the image, where we used `scale=32`.   

### Logging
---
You can use either Wandb or Tensorboard to log and visualize your training landscape. The install setup provided includes support for both of them.

#### WanDB Logging

To setup Wandb:

1. Create an account on [Wandb](https://wandb.ai) website
2. Get the API key from your account and set corresponding environment variable using `export WANDB_API_KEY=<Your Key>`
3. Enable Wandb logging during training using  `python run_ray_train.py --wandb=True`

#### Tensorboard Logging

To visualize your results with TensorBoard, run: `tensorboard --logdir <results_dir>`


## Identified issues with Ray 2.6.1

During our training, we found issues with both tf and torch backends that leads to errors when using default lstm wrapper provided by rllib. Our installation script above provides fix patches `ray_patch.sh` for the same. But if you use the manual installation approach, the following fixes need to be applied after installation:

*  For tf users:

In your Python library folder, in the file ray/rllib/policy/sample_batch.py, replace line 636 with the following snippet:

```python
time_lengths = tree.map_structure(lambda x: len(x), data[next(iter(data))])
flattened_lengths = tree.flatten(time_lengths)
assert all(t == flattened_lengths[0] for t in flattened_lengths)
data_len = flattened_lengths[0]
```

* For torch users:

In your Python library folder, in the file ray/rllib/models/torch/complex_input_net.py replace line 181 with:

```python
self.num_outputs = concat_size if not self.post_fc_stack else self.post_fc_stack.num_outputs
```
